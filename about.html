                        <p>I understand the moment because I've lived it.</p>
                        <p>As a former collegiate soccer player who captained both my high school team in Charlottesville and later led Longwood College as their captain andleading scorer, I know the intensity, dedication, and pure emotion that flows through every sports moment. Growing up, my brother and I played virtually every sport imaginable, but we have no photographic record of those formative years - something that drives my passion for preserving these irreplaceable moments for today's student-athletes.</p>
                        <p>Now, as a full-time middle school teacher and coach at St. Christopher's School, I bring over 20 years of experience working with young people to my sports photography. Coaching middle school soccer and both middle school and JV tennis keeps me actively involved in student athletics, giving me an insider's perspective on both the competitive and developmental sides of student life. I understand the pressure, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the growth that happens on and off the field because I witness it daily from the sidelines.</p>
                        <p>My transition from player to photographer happened naturally. I remain connected to the athletic world on multiple levels - as an athlete who plays tennis competively on a weekly basis, and as a coach developing young athletes in soccer and tennis at St. Christopher's. This ongoing involvement keeps me sharp to the rhythms and emotions of competition while capturing it through my lens. I shoot with professional Canon R7 equipment and premium glass (RF 24-70mm F2.8, RF 70-200mm F2.8, and RF 100-500mm F4), but the real advantage isn't my gear - it's my ability to anticipate the moments that matter.</p>
                        <p>I specialize in high-action, high-energy sports photography across Richmond's private school athletics scene, covering everything from soccer and football to wrestling, track, lacrosse, and tennis. My style emphasizes bright, accurate colors and authentic emotional moments because I believe sports photography should celebrate both athletic achievement and personal growth.</p>
                        <p>My Christian faith guides how I approach both teaching and photography - with integrity, genuine care for young people, and a commitment to excellence that honors the trust families place in me. As both educator and photographer, I'm privileged to document student-athletes during some of their most defining moments.</p>
                        <p>Every image I deliver meets my professional standards because quality is non-negotiable. I won't compromise on the standards that would make me proud to display these moments in my own home. When you work with Z Photography, you're not just hiring a photographer - you're partnering with someone who genuinely understands the journey your student-athlete is on, because I've walked that path myself.</p>
