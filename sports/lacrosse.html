                    <h2>Pure Speed Meets Controlled Violence</h2>
                    <p>The lightning-quick release of a 100+ mph shot, the thunderous collision of a perfectly timed check, the athletic artistry of a behind-the-back pass threading through traffic. Lacrosse combines the speed of hockey with the strategy of soccer and the physicality of football, creating some of the most electrifying moments in all of sports. As a sports photographer serving Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield, Short Pump, Glen Allen, and Hanover, I've discovered that lacrosse photography demands split-second timing and an understanding of controlled chaos.</p>
                    <p>Having coached lacrosse gives me an insider's understanding of the game's tactical elements, but 2024 marks my first season bringing that knowledge behind the camera lens. This fresh perspective has reignited my passion for sports photography in ways I didn't expect. Knowing the game as a coach - understanding when a fast break is developing, recognizing defensive breakdowns, anticipating where the next scoring opportunity will emerge - combined with the excitement of capturing these moments for the first time creates an energy that shows in every frame. From the precision of a midfielder's dodge to the raw power of a close-range shot, I'm discovering lacrosse photography with the enthusiasm of someone experiencing the sport's visual drama for the first time.</p>

            <h2>Serving Richmond Area Lacrosse Programs</h2>
            <p>Whether you're coaching varsity lacrosse at St. Christopher's, developing players at one of the many elite lacrosse clubs in the area, or directing athletics at St. Catherine's, I provide professional sports photography that captures the skill, strategy, and controlled aggression that defines lacrosse. I work with teams throughout Henrico County, Chesterfield County, and the greater Richmond metro area including Glen Allen and Hanover.</p>
            <p>Lacrosse combines tactical sophistication with explosive athleticism in ways that constantly surprise me behind the camera. From the chess-match strategy I understood as a coach to the split-second visual drama I'm discovering as a photographer, every game teaches me something new about capturing this incredible sport. This fresh perspective, grounded in tactical knowledge but energized by photographic discovery, creates images that feel both informed and genuinely excited about lacrosse's endless possibilities.</p>
