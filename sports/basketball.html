                <h2>Pure Energy on the Hardwood</h2>
                <p>Basketball is pure energy on the hardwood - the explosive drive to the basket, the perfectly timed jump shot, the celebration after a game-winning three-pointer. As both a former collegiate basketball player and experienced sports photographer serving Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield, Short Pump, Glen Allen, and Hanover, I understand the rhythm of the game and know exactly when those decisive moments happen.</p>
                <p>Having played competitively through college, including serving as team captain and leading scorer, I bring an insider's perspective to every game I photograph. I know where to position myself for that crucial fast break, when a player is about to make their move, and how to capture the raw emotion that makes basketball photography so compelling.</p>
