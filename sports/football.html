                <h2>Friday Night Lights, Captured Forever</h2>
                <p>The roar of the crowd, the crack of shoulder pads, the perfect spiral cutting through stadium lights. High school football represents the pinnacle of athletic passion in Richmond, and as a sports photographer serving the metro area including Henrico, Chesterfield, Short Pump, Glen Allen, and Hanover, I understand that football photography demands both technical mastery and deep knowledge of the game.</p>
                <p>My athletic background, coaching experience, and years of photographing competitive sports give me the field awareness to capture the bone-crushing tackle, the touchdown celebration, and the quiet determination in a quarterback's eyes before the snap. Having coached football, I understand the game from both sides of the ball - knowing when a blitz is coming, recognizing formation changes, and anticipating the explosive plays before they develop. Football moves fast and hits hard, but I know exactly where to be when history happens on your field.</p>
